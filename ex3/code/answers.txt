I think i got a better result using LOESS. The result using LOESS appears to be smoother than the Kalman's. In some small part, Kalman's plot has some unrealistic steep oscillations.

If the data is collected from another independent sensor (not calculated from lat/lon data), we could use this data to create a estimated "next" cooridinate. Something like inertial location system in a commercial airplane.
