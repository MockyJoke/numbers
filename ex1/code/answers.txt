1.  I found it easier to work with numpy, as it works with array directly, which is easier to manipulate.
    while codes written in pandas might be easier to read, as functions like np.reshape() might not reflect the semantic meaning of the operation (e.g. group data quarterly)
2.  Using loop: 791 ms per loop
    Using pandas buildin function: 30.7 ms per loop
    Using loop requires to convert numpy/pandas data into python objects, which is allocated on the heap. As data are not stored continuously in heap.
    Memory caching provides little to none benefit in this scenario. Thus there's a approximate 20x performance difference between the 2 approachs.
