I cached the dataframe right after the json data files are read(before first join), since the comments dataframe are used multiple times later.
I also cached the dataframe where it stores the newly calculated rel_score.
If no cached used, especially the first dataframe, the json files will need to be read more than one times since the data will be disposed in the middle of the calculation.

Broadcasting small dataframe seems before joining seems improved the performance a lot.
